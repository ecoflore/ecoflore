### Goals

#### A sustainable, eco-friendly and innovative solution

This is the idea behind **ECOFLORE**.  
Our university team is developing an **electrically-assisted planting vehicle**, specifically designed to:

- operate in hard-to-reach or sloped areas,
- accelerate planting efforts while reducing physical workload,
- preserve fragile ecosystems through eco-friendly design.

Our mission is clear: **to develop a versatile, local, and sustainable solution** to help communities, cities, and environmental organizations better protect our natural environments.
