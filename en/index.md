## ðŸŒ± Ecoflore Project

Whether along rivers, coastal zones, or human-altered environments, **shoreline erosion** is a major issue in Quebec and around the world. Soil degradation threatens biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and the surrounding infrastructure.

One of the most effective ways to mitigate this phenomenon is through the **replanting of specific vegetation** in vulnerable areas â€” the roots help stabilize the soil. However, current methods are **manual, slow, labor-intensive**, and **inefficient** because the agricultural machinery available today is neither suited to the diversity of terrains encountered nor always designed with sustainability in mind.

This is where **Ã‰COFLORE** comes in. 

Our team stands out by offering a **versatile and environmentally-friendly** solution, capable of accelerating and optimizing replanting efforts in sensitive and hard-to-access areas.
